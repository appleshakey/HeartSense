The hardware module is a compact system designed to capture and transmit **ECG signals** for heart health analysis. It comprises an **Arduino** microcontroller, an **ECG sensor**, and a **Wi-Fi module**. The ECG sensor records real-time cardiac activity, which the Arduino processes to ensure signal quality. The Wi-Fi module enables wireless transmission of the data to a cloud platform or a web application for further analysis, such as detecting arrhythmias. This setup is efficient for real-time health monitoring and integrates seamlessly with machine learning models for heart disease prediction.
