The **Framingham dataset** contains various columns representing clinical and demographic features related to cardiovascular health. These features are typically used to calculate the **Framingham Risk Score** and predict the likelihood of developing cardiovascular diseases. Below is a list of common columns included in the dataset:

### **Demographic Features**:
1. **Age**: Age of the individual (in years).
2. **Sex**: Gender of the individual (1 = Male, 0 = Female).
3. **Education**: Level of education (categorical, often coded as integers).

### **Lifestyle Factors**:
4. **CigsPerDay**: Average number of cigarettes smoked per day.
5. **BPMeds**: Whether the individual is on blood pressure medication (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

### **Medical History**:
6. **PrevalentStroke**: History of stroke (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
7. **PrevalentHyp**: History of hypertension (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
8. **Diabetes**: Whether the individual has diabetes (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

### **Clinical Measurements**:
9. **TotChol**: Total cholesterol level (mg/dL).
10. **SysBP**: Systolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
11. **DiaBP**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
12. **BMI**: Body Mass Index (weight in kg divided by height in mÂ²).
13. **HeartRate**: Resting heart rate (beats per minute).
14. **Glucose**: Glucose level (mg/dL).

### **Target Variable**:
15. **TenYearCHD**: Whether the individual developed coronary heart disease (CHD) within 10 years (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

This dataset is particularly valuable for understanding the relationships between these factors and the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases.
