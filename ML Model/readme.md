# Ten Year Early Prediction of Heart Failure

This project combines the **Framingham Risk Score (FRS)** and **ECG image analysis** for a 10-year early prediction of heart failure. A **Random Forest Classifier** predicts risk using clinical features like age, cholesterol, and blood pressure, while **EfficientNetB0** analyzes ECG images to classify arrhythmic heartbeats. Together, these approaches enhance early detection and enable timely interventions to prevent heart failure.
